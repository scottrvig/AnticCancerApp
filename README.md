# AnticCancerApp
Mobile application for displaying information about chemotherapeutic medication.

This project was a group project for my fourth year of University (CMPUT 401).  Our team had 7 members.

The intended use is to improve and promote the pharmacist's role in oral chemotherapy medication management.  The goal was to create a mobile application supported by a backend server that can display a high level summary of the risks and dosages regarding a set of drugs.  Oral chemotherapeutics can be extremely dangerous and a slight error in perscriptions could cost a life, so the ultimate goal would be to help make perscribing and distributing oral chemotherapeutics a bit safer.

My role for this project was mostly to help develop the mobile application, so that is the only code that I've uploaded here.   Despite my personal desire to develop for Android and iOS separately, we were encouraged to use the PhoneGap mobile development framework, which allows for easy porting between Android, iPhone, BlackBerry, and webOS.
